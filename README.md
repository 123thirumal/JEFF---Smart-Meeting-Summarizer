- Generate an API key for your project.

4. **Create Google Drive API**  
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)  
- Enable Google Drive API and create a project.

5. **Create OAuth Credentials**  
- In Google Cloud Console, create OAuth 2.0 credentials.  
- Download `token.json` after completing the OAuth setup.

6. **Create a folder in Google Drive**  
- Make a folder to store audio files.  
- Give **editor access** to the OAuth user created in step 5.

7. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with the following variables:  
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key  
GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_gdrive_folder_id

8. **Store `token.json`**  
- Place `token.json` inside the `gdrive_api` folder in your project.

9. **Run the backend server**  
Run `uvicorn --reload main:app` from your project folder.

10. **Run the frontend**  
Navigate to your frontend folder and start it (for example, with React: `npm install` then `npm start`).

Your project should now be running locally with all APIs connected.
